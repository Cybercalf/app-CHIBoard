### The original developers

陈怡君(Chen Yijun)
胡未名(Hu Weiming)

### Features

1.  极其简洁的界面设计，让“棋盘”仅仅是“棋盘”，应用内无任何广告、教程、外部链接等分散使用者注意力的内容；

2.  定制功能，给予用户充分的自由空间。通过应用内丰富的内置选择或者自己上传图片，用户可以定制棋盘的样式、背景、棋子的样式等等；

3.  应用尽可能保持单机运行，任何运行应用的设备，包括手机、平板电脑、笔记本电脑，都成为且仅仅成为“棋盘”，玩家在棋盘两侧进行对弈，保证最原始的下棋体验；

4.  用户可以随时在对局过程中选择撤销操作“悔棋”，也可以在对局结束后选择保存对局记录，随时复盘；

## Q&A

### Why you name it "CHIBoard"?

CHIBoard的前两个字母“C”“H”分别为两位组员姓氏拼音的第一个字母；“I”为“Integrated”的缩写，意为“集成的”；“Board”取“棋盘”之意。总体含义为：由陈怡君和胡未名共同开发的、集合多种类型棋盘的应用程序。

### Why you decide to develop CHIBoard?

市面上缺少集成多种棋类游戏的应用；市面上绝大部分的棋类游戏内置广告、教程等付费内容，抑或“成就”“签到”等无谓的功能，分散使用者注意力。我们相信，设计一款功能齐全、简洁直观，同时给予用户充分自由的棋类应用可以让许多棋类爱好者的生活更加便捷、多彩。

### What can I do with CHIBoard?

利用该应用可以进行世界流行的几乎所有的棋类游戏，包括但不仅限于：象棋、国际象棋、跳棋、西洋跳棋、五子棋、四子棋、独立钻石棋、斗兽棋、围棋、军棋等。

### How to play

If you are a developer, you can open the project using android studio, compile and run it and it will be ready to use. The app is very simple and you can explore for yourself what it can or can't do yet. See "doc/tech.md" for technical details and "doc/todo.md" for features that are not implemented or need to be optimised.
If you are not a developer, we are sorry to say that **the project is not yet complete, so there is no official release of the app**.

### More Information

For more information on this app, please see all the documents in the "doc/" folder. We hope that most of the questions can be answered from the files inside this folder. If you have any other questions, welcome to contact us. **Please notice that some of the context are written in Chinese.**

"progress-report.md": This file records what we initially wanted the app to do, what each developer has contributed to the project and the process of developing the project, so you can see how we put our ideas into practice step by step.

"tech.md": This file documents all the techniques we apply in our projects. The techniques here mainly mean the use of some classes in java, the classic patterns of programming, and so on. Please notice that this project was originally used for a programming course assignment (we were just normal first year undergraduates when we started writing this document XD), so the main purpose of this document is to let the teacher or anyone else know that **we do used what we learned in class to develop this project**. If you are interested, you can also open it to see the techniques we have used and give your valuable comments.

"todo.md": What can be done to improve the project and what features have not been implemented are available in this file. Honestly, the time and effort we put into this project was really minimal, so after just a few weeks of development we were left with quite a few regrets. If you can contribute to this app, we will appreciate it.

"notes-for-developers.md": This document is used to tell other developers about some suggests and limits on improving this project. It is important to write this document and have others read it in order not to contradict the purpose for which we originally designed this app. It mainly covers what features are <u>**not**</u> allowed to be added to the project. If you have improved the project, but it goes against our design principles or conflicts with the rules documented in this file, your "pull request" will be easily unacceptable.
