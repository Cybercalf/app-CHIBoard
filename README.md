## Q&A

### Why you name it "CHIBoard"?

The first two letters of CHIBoard, "C" and "H", are the first letters of the surnames of the two members; "I" is the abbreviation for "Integrated"; "Board" means "chessboard". I" is an abbreviation of "Integrated", meaning "integrated"; "Board" means "chessboard". The overall meaning is: an application developed by Chen Yijun and Hu Weiming that brings together various types of chess boards.

### Why you decide to develop CHIBoard?

There is a lack of apps on the app market that integrate multiple chess games; most of the chess games on the market have built-in advertisements, tutorials and other paid content, or unnecessary features such as 'achievements' and 'check-ins' that distract users. We believe that a fully functional, simple and intuitive chess app with plenty of freedom for the user would make the lives of many chess enthusiasts easier and more colourful.

### What can I do with CHIBoard?

Once CHIBoard is completed, you can use the app to play almost all of the world's popular board games, including but not limited to: Chinese chess, chess, checkers, backgammon, quadrille, independent diamond chess, brawl, Go, military chess and more. Currently you can only play Go.

### How to play

If you are a developer, you can open the project using android studio, compile and run it and it will be ready to use. The app is very simple and you can explore for yourself what it can or can't do yet. See "doc/tech.md" for technical details and "doc/todo.md" for features that are not implemented or need to be optimised.
If you are not a developer, we are sorry to say that **the project is not yet complete, so there is no official release of the app**.

### More Information

For more information on this app, please see all the documents in the "doc/" folder. We hope that most of the questions can be answered from the files inside this folder. If you have any other questions, welcome to contact us. **Please notice that some of the context are written in Chinese.**

`progress-report.md`: This file records what we initially wanted the app to do, what each developer has contributed to the project and the process of developing the project, so you can see how we put our ideas into practice step by step.

`tech.md`: This file documents all the techniques we apply in our projects. The techniques here mainly mean the use of some classes in java, the classic patterns of programming, and so on. Please notice that this project was originally used for a programming course assignment (we were just normal first year undergraduates when we started writing this document XD), so the main purpose of this document is to let the teacher or anyone else know that <u>**we do used what we learned in class to develop this project**</u>. If you are interested, you can also open it to see the techniques we have used and give your valuable comments.

`todo.md`: What can be done to improve the project and what features have not been implemented are available in this file. Honestly, the time and effort we put into this project was really minimal, so after just a few weeks of development we were left with quite a few regrets. If you can contribute to this app, we will appreciate it.

`notes-for-developers.md`: This document is used to tell other developers about some suggests and limits on improving this project. It is important to write this document and have others read it in order not to contradict the purpose for which we originally designed this app. It mainly covers what features are <u>**not**</u> allowed to be added to the project. If you have improved the project, but it goes against our design principles or conflicts with the rules documented in this file, your "pull request" will be easily unacceptable.
