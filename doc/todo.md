I wanted to start by showing you what we initially wanted the app to look like.

1.  极其简洁的界面设计，让“棋盘”仅仅是“棋盘”，应用内无任何广告、教程、外部链接等分散使用者注意力的内容；

2.  定制功能，给予用户充分的自由空间。通过应用内丰富的内置选择或者自己上传图片，用户可以定制棋盘的样式、背景、棋子的样式等等；

3.  应用尽可能保持单机运行，任何运行应用的设备，包括手机、平板电脑、笔记本电脑，都成为且仅仅成为“棋盘”，玩家在棋盘两侧进行对弈，保证最原始的下棋体验；

4.  用户可以随时在对局过程中选择撤销操作“悔棋”，也可以在对局结束后选择保存对局记录，随时复盘；

Despite our very ambitious ambitions, as of 26 May 2021 we have completed less than a seventh of the project's total progress and, even more heartbreakingly, the completed parts are difficult to manage. We may rewrite the project in the future, but we will not turn down your valuable input on the project.

The current issues that we urgently need to address are as follows.

- Restructuring the project structure using a package management approach
- Implement draw and play action on boards other than the Go board
- Add a 'history' function to the app to record every move made by the user on the board
- The other "TODO" in the project

We would be grateful if you could handle one or more of the above issues.
