We want everyone to be involved in building the project, but we don't want your ideas to go against our original vision for the app. This document has been written to prevent your valuable contributions from going waste.

- Submissions that complete the tasks listed in `todo.md` will be prioritised
- Prohibit adding check-ins, achievements, etc. to the app
- Prohibit the addition of network-related features to the app, such as online, user login systems, etc.
